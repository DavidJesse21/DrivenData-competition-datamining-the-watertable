# DrivenData-competition-datamining-the-watertable
My first volunteer Data Science project. I have built a random forest machine learning model to predict the functionality of wells in Tanzania.

The repository contains:
- the original data provided by DrivenData
- my Python notebook
- a zip folder with spatial data of Tanzania (for visualization purposes)
- my final predictions

Furthermore the .docx documents contain some kind of documentation for myself, which is however not really relevant or informative for external viewers. I just used them to keep track of my progress in exploring, cleansing and engineering the data.
I uploaded those documents anyway because I think it helped me a lot to overview my project.
